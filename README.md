# AR Associations Drill: At the Races

## Summary
This challenge is a drill to work with [Active Record associations][RailsGuides Associations].  We'll be working with [`:belongs_to`][belongs_to] and [`:has_many`][has_many] associations.  We'll practice breaking Active Record conventions and passing options like `:class_name`, `:through`, and `:source` when declaring associations.

*Figure 1*. Schema design for this challenge.

We'll focus on writing associations in this challenge, but let's imagine that we're building a full application that allows for scheduling races.  Then, jockeys can sign up to ride a horse in a race.  Figure 1 shows a schema that will support this described functionality. 

When our associations have been written, we'll be able to answer the following questions.

*For an entry ...*

1. Which jockey is entering a race?
2. Which horse is being ridden?
3. For which race was the entry made?

*For a horse ...*

1. In which races has the horse been ridden?
2. Which jockeys have ridden the horse?

*For a jockey ...*

1. Which races has the jockey entered?
2. Which horses has a jockey ridden?

*For a race ...*

1. Which jockeys have ridden in the race?
2. Which horses have ridden in the race?


### Breaking Convention
Active Record provides a lot of functionality with very little codeâ€”provided that we follow its conventions.  However, sometimes it is necessary or desirable to break these conventions.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :viewed_items, { through: views }
  has_many :purchased_items, { through: purchases }
  has_many :reviewed_items, { through: reviews }
  
  has_many :views
  has_many :purchases
  has_many :reviews
end
```
*Figure 2*. Defining multiple associations between a user and items.

When might it be necessary to break conventions with regard to naming our associations?  Associations exist between models.  If a given model has two different associations with another model, they need different names.  Imagine an online shopping application with a `User` model and and `Item` model.  A user might have viewed items, purchased items, and reviewed items (see Figure 2).  

All of these associations would be between `User` and `Item`. What would happen if these associations all had the same name (e.g., `:items`).  We'll remember that declaring these associations creates methods for instances of `User`.  The first time we declare `has_many :items`, methods like `:items` and `:items=` are created.  What happens is a second `has_many :items` association is declared?  New `:items` and `:items=` methods would be written, essentially overwriting the first set of methods.  To avoid this, we sometimes need to break conventions in declaring associations.

And then sometimes we want to break convention because it makes our code more readable.  In the example above, what would it mean for a user to have many items?  What relationship would such an association represent?  Is it viewed items, purchased items, reviewed items, items they have for sale, etc.?  As with variable and method names, we want the names of our associations to be descriptive of the actual relationship between the two models.
