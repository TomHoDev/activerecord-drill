# Seeds - Below write the necessary code to seed the database
# so the tests pass.
#
# 1) Create four horses:
#    | name              | breed           |
#    ---------------------------------------
#    | Stardust          | Arabian         |
#    | Allstar           | Mustang         |
#    | Nitro             | Dutch Warmblood |
#    | Hotshot           | Arabian         |
#
#
#   After completing step #1, all the tests in spec/01_horses_spec.rb should pass.






# 2) Create three jockeys:
#    | name              | height_in_inches    | weight    |
#    -------------------------------------------------------
#    | Flying Franny     | 60                  | 115       |
#    | Lightning Larry   | 62                  | 117       |
#    | Slender Sally     | 57                  | 108       |
#    | Tiny Tim          | 54                  | 119       |
#
#   After completing step #2, all the tests in spec/02_jockeys_spec.rb should pass.







# 3) Now things get more complicated. Create one race with three participants.
#    The participation of a horse & jockey combination should be modeled as an
#    Appearance.
#
#    Race name: "Pretty High Stakes"
#    Winner: Flying Franny & Allstar
#
#    | jockey            | horse      | uniform_color     |
#    ------------------------------------------------------
#    | Flying Franny     | Allstar    | violet            |
#    | Lightning Larry   | Nitro      | green             |
#    | Slender Sally     | Hotshot    | blue              |
#
#   After completing step #3, all the tests in spec/03_stakes_spec.rb should pass.







# 4) Now let's get some more practice, time to create another race.
#
#    Race name: "Double Time Derby"
#    Winner: Tiny Tim & Stardust
#
#    | jockey            | horse      | uniform_color     |
#    ------------------------------------------------------
#    | Slender Sally     | Nitro      | pink              |
#    | Lightning Larry   | Hotshot    | white             |
#    | Flying Franny     | Allstar    | red               |
#    | Tiny Tim          | Stardust   | orange            |
#
#   After completing step #4, all the tests in spec/04_derby_spec.rb should pass.





# Lastly, try running spec/05_race_history_spec.rb Everything should pass!
